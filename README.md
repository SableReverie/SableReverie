## About Me
<!-- Comment -->

I'm 18 years old, Computer Engineering student at Caraga State University. I'm passionate about strengthening my programming and communication skills to collaborate effectively in professional environments. My primary focus is on becoming proficient in C++, and Python, with long-term goal of becoming a Game Developer.

Currently, I am actively working on various projects and striving to improve any day. I am also developing my time management and task handling abilities, which I believe are essential for both academic and professional success. With continuous learning and dedication, I hope to bring my skills into real-world applications in the near future.
